# Design-of-a-Crystal-Wavelength-Demultiplexer-Using-Machine-Learning

My undergraduate thesis aimed to calculate the propagation of two frequencies of 
light through a photonic crystal slab using a tight binding approximation. This is done using 
a past students existing code and the code committed to this repo. Machine learning model to be 
committed when confirmed to be successful.
